# OpenGL
Code that I write to learn and practice OpenGL API and C++.

To learn the OpenGL API, I use the tutorials on this website: https://learnopengl.com/ and watch videos on youtube like The Cherno youtube channel's videos (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject).

Most of the code in this repository may seem quite messy from the software engineering point of view. That is due to the fact that I do not abstract it into classes and higher level functions, instead, I just write the majority of the code directy in the main function. I do so because I don't want to make an aplication, a rendering engine or library, I just try to figure out how OpenGL and C++ work and I have to follow the tutorials.
